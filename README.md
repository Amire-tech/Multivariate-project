# Multivariate-project
Multivariate Statistical Analysis 
In this project, it is the intention to analyze a chosen data set with the techniques discussed in the Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis course, 
with as ultimate objective the development of a good classification model. The analysis/report is not only restricted to the classification analysis alone, 
other techniques are used to achieve insight in the data or as tools to achieve the classifier.
